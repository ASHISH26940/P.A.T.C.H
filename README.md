## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation (Frontend)

To get P.A.T.C.H running locally for development:

**1. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ashish26940/p.a.t.c.h.git
cd p.a.t.c.h
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**3. Configure Environment Variables:**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8001 # For local development
# For production/deployment, this should be your deployed backend domain (e.g., https://kaizol.in)
```

**4. Run the development server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## üîå Backend API (CogniFlow API)

P.A.T.C.H relies on a separate backend API for its core functionality, including AI processing, authentication, and data management. This backend is likely hosted at: [https://kaizol.in](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://kaizol.in)

**To run the backend locally (for full development experience), please refer to its dedicated repository (if available) or ensure it's running and accessible at `http://localhost:8001`.**

The backend services typically include:

  * `cogniflow_postgres` (PostgreSQL database)
  * `cogniflow_redis` (Redis for caching/sessions)
  * `cogniflow_chromadb` (ChromaDB for vector embeddings)
  * `cogniflow_api` (The main FastAPI application)

These are usually managed via `docker-compose.yml`.
